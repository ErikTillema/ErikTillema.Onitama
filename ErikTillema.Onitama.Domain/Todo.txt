	TODO

- give score to GameState: higher score is higher probability of winning
- do deeper search by not investigating branches with low score
- assume also that opponent will not follow low score branches?

	OTHER RULES
- Keeping the king on the base seems to make a lot of sense to me, certainly when the king's attacking power is not necessary.
- it seems that the tiger card (and maybe dragon) is more valuable than other cards. 
  It makes sense to keep valuable cards for the right moment, rather than playing them and giving them to the opponent.

	SCORING GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
- more pawns is better than less pawns
- losing a pawn is ok if you can retake a pawn after
- pawns that cannot be captured are better
- pawns close to attacking the enemy base or king are better
- find paths to enemy base?
- more paths are better?

	SCORING
- winning position has score +infinity
- losing position has score -infinity
- create a family of static evaluation functions, based on a number of properties:
+ material: number of pawns
+ mobility: number of moves that can be made
? center control
+ exposed: 1 or 2 targets: king stands on base or not
+ king safety: squares between enemy and king
+ base safety: squares between enemy and base


	HOW TO MAXIMIZE SCORE
- do minimax
- alpha beta search:
